Page 2 of 2

This is 2 of 2 pages for this assignment.
this is part of a webpage that displays a personal website that simply displays some photos
that I like as well as discuss a bit about me and my inspiration. It is used to display some key features that I have learned to do with
CSS and HTML in this course.

        <p>I grew up in a rural region of central BC, so I spent <i><b> a lot </b></i> of time in the mountains. It is where I learned to have a passion for understanding how things work. Growing up, this revolved around a curiosity of engineering projects I would build out of cardboard and wood. This stemmed into an interest in renewable energy systems and biology; <i>which are seemingly as alike as they are dissimilar.</i></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>As time went on it became clear that the bridge between my interests was embedded within the tech world. It achieves both an interest in building and engineering, with an aspect of biology in the biomimicry of many designs. What I love about it is that it is endlessly challenging and the opportunity for creation is anything but finite.</p>
