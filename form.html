COMP 2681, Assignment 3 HTML file

This html file is used to create the contact form for my website. this contact form is functional, however it does not utilize the "action" attribute
so there is no processing done (by handlers) on the data that is enterred. 
Colors used are distinguishable when considering various colour blind conditions and visual impairments. 
The text and boxes enlarge in unison if someone was to zoom the screen in fully (I will disucss this more in the CSS file).
Title attributes have enough information that if someone was visually impaired and trying to fill out the form, they would be able to navigate the text boxes. 
Placeholders are added where they appear to add benefit, but left out in seome cases where they made the form look busy/ cluttered or where they were unneeded. 
Pattern attirbutes are used to validate the individual adds their province, postal code, and phone number correctly.
